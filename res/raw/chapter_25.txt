Good is restraint of the eye; good is restraint of the ear; good is restraint of the nose; good is the restraint of the tongue.
%
Good is restraint in deed; good is restraint in speech; good is restraint in mind; good is restraint in everything. The Bhikkhu, restrained at all points, is freed from sorrow.
%
He who is controlled in hand, in foot, in speech, and in the highest (i.e. the head); he who delights in meditation, and is composed; he who is alone, and is contented, - him they call a Bhikkhu.
%
The Bhikkhu who is controlled in tongue, who speaks wisely, who is not puffed up, who explains the meaning and the text, - sweet, indeed, is his speech.
%
That Bhikkhu who dwells in the Dhamma, who delights in the Dhamma, who meditates on the Dhamma, who well remembers the Dhamma, does not fall away from the sublime Dhamma.
%
Let him not despise what he has received, nor should he live envying (the gains of) others. The Bhikkhu who envies (the gains of) others does not attain concentration.
%
Though receiving but little, if a Bhikkhu does not despise his own gains, even the gods praise such a one who is pure in livelihood and is not slothful.
%
He who has no thought of ``I'' and ``mine'' whatever towards mind and body, he who grieves not for that which he has not, he is, indeed, called a Bhikkhu.
%
The Bhikkhu who abides in loving-kindness, who is pleased with the Buddha's Teaching, attains to that state of peace and happiness, the stilling of conditioned things.
%
Empty this boat, O Bhikkhu! Emptied by you it will move swiftly. Cutting off lust and hatred, to Nibbana you will thereby go.
%
Cut off the five fetters and pertaining to this shore (self-illusion, doubt, indulgence in wrongful rites and ceremonies, sense-desires and hatred), throw off the five fetters that pertain to the Further Shore (attachment to the realm of form, attachment to formless realms, conceit, restlessness and ignorance), cultivate further five faculties (confidence, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom). He who has destroyed the five fetters (lust, hatred, delusion, pride and false views) is called a ``Flood Crosser''.
%
Monks, meditate! Do not be heedless, pursue not the pleasure of sense to sway your heart lest the passions will toss you about and you will suffer.
%
There is no concentration in one who lacks wisdom, nor is there wisdom in him who lacks concentration. In whom are both concentration and wisdom, he, indeed, is in the presence of Nibbana.
%
The Bhikkhu who has retired to a lonely abode, who has calmed his mind, who perceives the doctrine clearly, experiences a joy transcdending that of men.
%
Whenever he reflects on the rise and fall of the Aggregates, he experiences joy and happiness. To ``those who know'' that (reflection) is Deathless.
%
And this becomes the beginning here for a wise Bhikkhu: sense-control, contentment, restraint with regard to the Fundamental Code (patimokkha), association with beneficent and energetic friends whose livelihood is pure.
%
Let him be cordial in his ways and refined in conduct; filled thereby with joy he will make an end of ill.
%
As the jasmine creeper sheds its withered flowers, even so, O Bhikkhu, should you totally cast off lust and hatred.
%
The Bhikkhu who is calm in body, calm in speech, calm in mind, who is well-composed, who has spewed out worldly things is truly called a ``peaceful one''.
%
By self do you censure yourself. By self do you examine yourself. Self-guarded and mindful, O Bhikkhu, you will live happily.
%
Self, indeed, is the protector of self. Self, indeed, is one's refuge. Control, therefore, your own self as a merchant controls a noble steed.
%
Full of joy, full of confidence in the Buddha's Teaching, the Bhikkhu will attain the Peaceful State, the stilling of conditioned things, the bliss (supreme).
%
The Bhikkhu who, while still young, devotes himself to the Buddha's Teaching, illuminates this world like the moon freed from a cloud.
