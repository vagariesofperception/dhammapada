The fickle, unsteady mind, so hard to guard, so hard to control, the wise man straightens, as the fletcher straightens the arrow.

The mind is very hard to perceive, extremely subtle and wanders at will. Let the wise person guard it; a guarded mind is conducive to happiness.

He whose mind is not steadfast, he who knows not true doctrine, he whose confidence wavers - the wisdom of such a one will never be perfect.

He whose mind is not soaked (by lust), he who is not affected (by haunt), he who has transcended both good and evil - for such a vigilant one there is no fear.

Realising that this body is (as fragile) as a jar, establishing this mind (as firm) as a (fortified) city, he should attack Mara with the weapon of wisdom. He should guard his conquest and be without attachment.
%
Before long, alas! This body will lie upon the ground, cast aside, devoid of consciousness, even as a useless charred log.

Whatever (harm) a foe may do to a foe, or a hater to a hater, an ill-directed mind can do one far greater (harm).
