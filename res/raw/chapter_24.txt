The craving of the heedless man grows like a Maluva (all entangling) creeper. He runs hither and thither (from one life to another) like a monkey in the forest looking for fruit.
%
Whosoever in this world is overcome by this base craving, this clinging (to sense objects), his sorrows grow like Birana grass after rain.
%
Whosoever in this world overcomes this base craving so hard to subdue, his sorrows fall away from him like water drops from a lotus leaf.
%
This I say to you all who has assemblied here: Dig up the root of craving like one in quest of Birana's sweet root. Let not Mara crush you again and again as a flood (crushes) a reed.
%
As a tree cut down begins to grow up again if its roots remain uninjured and firm, even so when the root of craving remain undestroyed, this suffering arises again and again.
%
A man who gives way to pleasure will be swept away by craving and his thoughts will make him suffer, like waves.
%
The streams (craving) flow everywhere. The creeper (craving) sprouts and stands. Seeing the creeper that has sprung up, with wisdom cut off the roots.
%
A man's joys are always transient, and since men devote themselves to pleasure, seeking after happiness, they undergo birth and decay.
%
Folk enwrapt in craving are terrified like a captive hare. Held fast by fetters and bonds, for long they come to sorrow again and again.
%
Folk enwrapt in craving are terrified like a captive hare. Therefore a Bhikkhu who wishes his own passionlessness (Nibbana) should discard craving.
%
Whosoever with no desire (for the household) finds pleasure in the forest (of asceticism) and, though freed from desire (for the household), (yet) runs back to that very home. Come, behold that man! Freed, he runs back into that very bondage.
%
That which is made of iron, wood or hemp, is not a strong bond, say the wise; the longing for jewels, ornaments, children, and wives is a far greater attachment.
%
That bond is strong, say the wise. It hurls down, is supple, and is hard to loosen. This too the wise cut off, and leave the world, with no longing, renouncing sensual pleasures.
%
Those who are infatuated with lust fall back into the stream as (does) a spider into the web spun by itself. This too the wise cut off and wander, with no longing, released from all sorrow.
%
Let go the past. Let go the future. Let go the present (front, back and middle). Crossing to the farther shore of existence, with mind released from everything, do not again undergo birth and decay.
%
For the person who is perturbed by (evil) thoughts, who is exceedingly lustful, who contemplates pleasant things, craving increases more and more. Surely he makes the bond (of Mara) stronger.
%
He who delights in subduing (evil) thoughts, who meditates on ``the loathsomeness'' (of the body), who is ever mindful, - it is he who will make an end (of craving). He will sever Mara's bond.
%
He who has reached the goal, is fearless, is without craving, is passionless, has cut off the thorns of life. This is his final body.
%
He who is without craving and grasping, who is skilled in etymology and terms, who knows the grouping of letters and their sequence, - it is he who is called the bearer of the final body, one of profound wisdom, a great man.
%
All have I overcome, all do I know. From all am I detached. All have I renounced. Wholly absorbed am I in ``the destruction of craving''. Having comprehended all by myself, whom shall I call my teacher?
%
The gift of Truth excels all (other) gifts. The flavour of Truth excels all (other) flavours. The pleasure in Truth excels all (other) pleasures. He who has destroyed craving overcomes all sorrow.
%
Riches ruin the foolish, but not those in quest of the Beyond (Nibbana). Through craving for riches the ignorant man ruins himself as (if he were ruining) others.
%
Weeds are the bane of fields, lust is the bane of mankind. Hence what is given to the lustless yields abundant fruit.
%
Weeds are the bane of fields, hatred is the bane of mankind. Hence what is given to those rid of hatred yields abundant fruit.
%
Weeds are the bane of fields, delusion is the bane of mankind. Hence what is given to those rid of delusion yields abundant fruit.
%
Weeds are the bane of fields, craving is the bane of mankind. Hence what is given to those rid of craving yields abundant fruit.
