If one holds oneself dear, one should protect oneself well. During every one of the three watches the wise man should keep vigil.
%
Let one first establish oneself in what is proper, and then instruct others. Such a wise man will not be defiled.
%
As he instructs others so should he himself act. Himself fully controlled, he should control (others); for oneself, indeed, is difficult to control.
%
Oneself, indeed, is one's saviour, for what other saviour would there be? With oneself well controlled one obtains a saviour difficult to find.
%
By oneself alone is evil done; it is self-born, it is self-caused. Evil grinds the unwise as a diamond grinds a hard gem.
%
Just as the creeper overspreads a Sal-tree and destroys it, the man who allows his wickedness to overcome him, suffers as much as his enemy would have him suffer.
%
Easy to do are things that are hard and not beneficial to oneself, but very, very difficult, indeed, to do is that which is beneficial and good.
%
Whosoever rejects the words of the noble, righteous Arahants, such a fool, because of his false views, brings forth on his head ruin and destruction, like the banana-tree which dies when it has borne fruit.
%
By oneself, indeed, is evil done; by oneself is one defiled. By oneself is evil left undone; by oneself, indeed, is one purified. Purity and impurity depend on oneself. No one purifies another.
%
For the sake of others' welfare, however, great, let not one neglect one's own welfare. Clearly perceiving one's own welfare, let one be intent on one's own goal.
